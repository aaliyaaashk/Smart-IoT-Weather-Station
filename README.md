# Smart-IoT-Weather-Station
🌦️💡 Excited to share my final year project – the Smart IoT Weather Station! 🚀✨
Built using an ESP32 microcontroller, this system collects real-time data from temperature 🌡️, humidity 💧, pressure 🌪️, rainfall 🌧️, and wind sensors 🌀—sending it to the cloud via AWS Lambda, DynamoDB for data storage, and SNS for processing and instant alerts (SMS/email)! 📩⚡

📡 It’s fully serverless, secured over HTTPS, and designed with a clean dashboard for live + historical weather insights 📊—perfect for smart agriculture, disaster readiness, and local climate tracking 🌱🌍.

💻 This project helped me strengthen my skills in IoT, embedded systems, cloud computing, and real-time automation. Immensely grateful for the learning experience and excited to keep building! 🙌
